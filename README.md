# University Rankings Analysis & Visualization with Power BI

This project analyzes global university ranking data for 1,500+ institutions, showcasing trends and key factors that influence rankings. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards to explore academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, internationalization, sustainability, and overall performance across regions and years.

- Interactive global map showing university distribution and scores by region
- Year-over-year ranking changes with trend analysis
- Detailed breakdown of ranking metrics including faculty quality, citations, and sustainability
- Filters for region, institution size, focus, and status for customized insights
- Comparative scatter plots to reveal relationships between key ranking factors
- Highlight of top-performing institutions and those with significant rank shifts

## Data Source
The dataset includes rankings for 2024 and 2025, with scores and ranks on multiple criteria for each university.

## Tools & Techniques
- Power BI Desktop for data modeling and visualization
- Data cleaning and transformation to handle missing values and data types
- DAX for calculated metrics such as rank change and score aggregations
- Interactive slicers and drill-through pages for in-depth exploration

## Insights
